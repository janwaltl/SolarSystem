File format of formatted text file used by FormattedFilerParser for storing simulated data


Description:
	Each unit must be enclosed withing {} brackets.
	Each parameter is declared using its name, followed by <> brackets enclosing parameter's value.
	Decimal numbers can be written with decimal point or in scientific format with exponent.
	There is no arithmetic, so 100/2 is not interpretted as 50 as IS INVALID input.
	Parser is quite forgiving. So parity of brackets is not stricly enforced as long as there is atleast one closing brackets.
	Also there can be more than one space between symbols(except in decimal numbers).
	Any extra symbols/texts are ignored(except between <>), so comments are allowed.
	All parametres are optional, so {} is valid unit. But when inputted, they must have correct format.

Following is list of all valid parametres with their format:

	name<string> - Name of the unit, only ASCII symbols are valid.
				 - Empty by default
	color<R G B A> - Color of the unit, 4 decimal numbers 0.0 do 1.0 representing color in RGBA format
				   - White by default.
	velocity<X Y> - Initial velocity of the unit. 2 decimal numbers without any physics units.
				  - Values are assumed to be in meters per second.
				  - (0,0) by default.
	position<X Y>  Initial position of the unit. 2 decimal numbers without any physics units.
				  - Values are assumed to be in meters.
				  - (0,0) by default.
	mass <X> - Mass of the unit. 1 decimal number without any physics units.
			 - Value is assumed to be in kilograms.
			 - 0 by default.


Example:

{ name <Sun >
  color <1.0 0.88 0.0 1.0 >
  position <0.0 0.0 >
  velocity <0.0 0.0 >
  mass <1.98843e30 > }

{ name <Earth >
  color <0.17 0.63 0.83 1.0 >
  position < 149.6e9 0.0 >
  velocity <0 29800.0 >
  mass <5.9736 e24 > }

{ name <Moon >
  color <0.2 0.2 0.2 1.0 >
  position < 150.0e9 0.0 >
  velocity <0 30822.0 >
  mass <7.3476e22 > }
