=====================================IN THIS COMMIT=====================================
Planning.
Added Vec3 class.
========================================IMPLEMENTING PLAN========================================
Remarks:
	Acknowledge third parties in documentation.
	Well, reorganize documentation.
		- probably not worth the effort.
		- but move user guide to beggining is doable
	Resolve speeding/slowing down while recording.
		- won't be easy - either we loose O(1) search in file or we get wrong replaying speed
			- went for wrong replaying speed for now

Plan:
	Create math library:
		- templatized vector
		- matrix 4x4 - including translation, rotation, projections
	Convert current 2D to 2D in 3D using vectors, matrices
		- Create Camera class
			- with LookAt functionallity
			- UBO with matrices
		- Use vectors and matrices for current drawing - lines, points
		- Controlled by keyboard
	Add ArcBall controlls
		- use mouse drag from ImGui
	Add Camera controlls
		- ability to follow a planet - both as target and as relative position
		- UI around planets to select them, target them, go to them
	Bonuses:
		Make Planets colored spheres
		And add shading with sun as lightsource
			- per-pixel, bloom
