=====================================IN THIS COMMIT=====================================
Got TrackBall working.
Added matrix inverse.
Implemented TestDrawer, which currently draws a cube.
Some more planning.
========================================IMPLEMENTING PLAN========================================
Remarks:
	Acknowledge third parties in documentation.
	Well, reorganize documentation.
		- probably not worth the effort.
		- but moving user guide to beggining is doable.
	Resolve speeding/slowing down while recording.
		- won't be easy - either we loose O(1) search in file or we get wrong replaying speed
			- went for wrong replaying speed for now
TODOs:
	Inverse of matrices in UBO in camera class if needed.
	Fix ReplayerViewer.
	Why is Ortho weirdly clipped when projecting to the center?
		- now projecting to near clipping plane, need to resolve it there's typo or bug in matrices somewhere.
Plan:
	Add ArcBall controlls
		- amount is controlled by mouse movement and action based on pressed buttons:
			- LeftMouse: rotate around center of screen
				- or camera's target
			- RightMouse: Panning to sides 
						- on plane with normal given by view direction and position by camera's position
						- move camera nad its target location
			- WheelMouse: Zooming
				- zoom to cam's target
			- MiddleMouse: LookAround
				- rotate using trackball from camera's position changing cam's target
	Design and implemented unit system
		- based on ratio in chrono would be best?

	UI overhaul:
		- Top-bar with dropdown windows
			- SimControls
				- just current SimControls
				- usage statistics
				- save/load/restart
				- name of current simMethod?
				- tickbox for break on collision?
				- graph of frameTime,FPS?
					- with stability line
			- SimData
				- Big window
				- choose reference frame and units
				- Tabs:
					- List of all simulated objects
						- with name, mass, position, distance, velocity, speed
							- ability to change them ( in stopped sim only?)
						- select on click( higlights it in view), ability to focus it
					- Graphs
						- conservation of energy
						- pos, dist, vel, speed
			- CameraControls
				- pos, targetPos, upDir
					- with ability to set 
				- Controls explained, maybe dynamic button and key mapping
				- status - free or following something
			- Visuals
				- maybe together with CameraControls
				- controls visual guidances:
					- grid with dynamic resolution
						- individual grid planes as well as 3D grid
						- ability to switch parts of it on/off, maybe change colors
					- pinheads with planets = projection on xz grid
						- ability to switch on/of, choose plane of projection
					- visual trackball - make it smaller to allow easier rolling
						- change size, position? (But keep it in screen coords)
	Bonuses:
		Make Planets colored spheres
		And add shading with sun as lightsource
			- per-pixel, bloom
		OpenGL state machine - OpenGLSM
		Kepler with all trajectories
