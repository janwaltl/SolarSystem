=====================================IN THIS COMMIT=====================================
New version of documentation.

Anti-aliasing.
	- Much nicer.
========================================IMPLEMENTING PLAN========================================
Next:
	V. Document it & ship it
		- Add simple explicit Euler?
		- Test NotTimed properly, try pause, getters...
		- put warning about changing SimTime while recording
		- Use composition for RecordedSim, ReplayedSim
		- force DTMult to be atleast one, when replaying
		Documentation:
			- make table data in theory part
			- give credits to last years physics course, numerical recipies
			- test implicit solution for correctness
			- viewers - ImGuiViewer
							- OpenGLBackEnd, ImGuiBackend - show examples of ImGui
							- explain lineTrails algorithm
							- somehow summarize GUIs
							- mention OMSAR in together with SimDataDrawer?
			- user guide
				- explain consoleControl
				- compiling for Windows
					- .sln should be enough
					- libraries are present
				- compiled binaries
					- redist
				- compiling for Linux
					- needs to compile GLFW and GLEW
					- make makefile?
				- bitbucket
	VI. OPTIONAL

		- Create physics unit system
			- can redefine simData_t to make it a structure with data and in what units they are
				- would also contain conversion function and all definitions of units
					- sort of like chrono - period, denominator,numerator
