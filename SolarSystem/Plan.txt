=====================================IN THIS COMMIT=====================================
Plenty of small fixes,tweaks in parser, recording.

As well as more work on ReplayerMethod.
	- Not working yet, but there's already plenty in this commit.
========================================IMPLEMENTING PLAN========================================
Next:
	Create sim method - test syncing of times, selecting correct entry...
	- or maybe create wrappers around Simulation - RecordedSimulation and ReplayedSimulation

	Test recording.

	Finish method.
		- pick correct entry based on simTime
			- offsets by simTime/tickTime
	Test viewing.

	Make GUI for viewer.
		- rewind/pause/resume/speed up buttons
		- as well as clickable timeline
		- even better would be to break down GUIDrawer and reconstruct IMGUIViewer without controls.
			- Just metrics and info really
	V. Document it & ship it
		- Constants instead of magic values
		- SORT all compile warnings
	VI. OPTIONAL
		- Names floating near units.(maybe just for the selected one & reference system)
		- Hustý by bylo zprovoznit multiStep øádu 8,9, udìlat textViewer, kterej všechno uloží do souboru.
			Nechat to bìžet na stolním PC pøes noc, pak udìlat ReplaySimMethod, který by jen podle simTime èasu nakopíroval
			správný údaje do simData, ktrý by pak IMGUIViewer v pohodì zobrazoval.

			- By mohlo bejt jako pøíklad v dokumentaci jak je to super rozšíøitelný.

SystemUnit is starting to have too many forwarding functions. Maybe give direct pointer to sim, but someway restrict
calling Start.
========================================THOUGHTS========================================

Controlling the simulation
	- By viewer - ability to Stop(End), Pause the simulation as well controlling its speed
					- Pause = just render
	Speed Control
		- DT - time step - to stay deterministic
		- accumulator - tries to make simulation real-time by multiple calls to simMethod with dt
						- in the end N.dt should match elapsed real time
		- speed can be changed by:
			1. increasing DT - takes bigger steps
							- well, it doesnt speed up anythings, just roughens or smoothens the simulation
							- big DT can lead to explosion, chaos, the end
			2. decrement acc by non-one multiple of DT
						- that would speed it up if multiple<1
							- for 1/2, it would simulate two seconds for each real-world-one
						- slow down if multiple>1
							- for 2 it would simulate one second for each 2 real-world-ones
						= but it does it at expense of CPU time, becuase m=1/2 would loop 2times more than default
							- so it might quickly get bottlenecked
			3. pass multiples of DT into SimMethod
						- that would speed it up at the expense of precision
						- basically it would take bigger leaps, but not trying to catch up to real world
						- m=60, for each DT siMethod would acts as 60DT was passed
							- so, for each real/world second, it would simulate one minute
						- m is conversion ratio between real-world time and simulated-time
							- for m=60*60*24 each second would be one day.
							- But simulation might be able to handle it, might result in explosions...
		- good speed control would employ all two(three).
			- Probably keep DT constant - everything can be achieved by other two.
			- and to speed up simulation it would do more loops(2,m<1). If it could not handle it(acc>0.5),
				it would instead multiply DT(2) and revert 2. Thus loosing bit of precision
			- That's exactly how transmission works, probably.

	- In cases where Viewer takes so much time, it can be configured so it is called only so many times a second.
		Because calling it fewer times does not break simulation, only slows responsivnes and "precision of viewing".
