Next:
	Add missing solar parser.
	ConsoleControl needs to be properly tested.

	V. Document it & ship it
		- Clean #include dependecies
		- Rename Settings to Constants.
		- Constants instead of magic values
		- SORT all compile warnings
		- go through all files, look for temp comments, includes, anything that is obsolete...
	VI. OPTIONAL
		- Little bit nicer/cleaner GUI.
			- Positions of windows. Allow different winSizes?
		- Create physics unit system
			- can redefine simData_t to make it a structure with data and in what units they are
				- would also contain conversion function and all definitions of units
					- sort of like chrono - period, denominator,numerator
		- Timing does not feel right
			- with all the casting, precision...
