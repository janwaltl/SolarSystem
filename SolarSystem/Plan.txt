=====================================IN THIS COMMIT=====================================
Started to work on Graphs window. Commit to save.
========================================IMPLEMENTING PLAN========================================

Remarks:
	Acknowledge third parties in documentation.
	Well, reorganize documentation.
		- probably not worth the effort.
		- but moving user guide to beggining is doable.
	Resolve speeding/slowing down while recording.
		- won't be easy - either we loose O(1) search in file or we get wrong replaying speed
			- went for wrong replaying speed for now
TODOs/IDEAS:
	Add Inverses of matrices in UBO in camera class if needed.
	Why is Ortho weirdly clipped when projecting to the center?
		- now projecting to near clipping plane, need to resolve it there's typo or bug in matrices somewhere.
	Camera's aspect ratio?
	Fix all Begin/End for windows
	Decide on Ratio class
		- too much work with operators, but it distinguishes it from simple double
Plan:
	UI overhaul:
		- Top-bar with dropdown windows
			- TopBar
				- StateButtons to open individual windows
				- Center:
					- play, pause, resume
			- SimControls
				- just current SimControls
				- usage statistics
				- save/load/restart
				- name of current simMethod?
				- tickbox for break on collision?
				- graph of frameTime,FPS?
					- with stability line
			- SimData - Done
			- CameraControls - Done
			- Graphs
				- ability to plot various functions of SimData
					- distance, speed between two objects or origin
						- x=time,y=value
					- total energy of system
						- tracks kinetic,
				- line graph - working on now
					- PushBack - adds new x,y pair
					- Clear - removes data
					- plot area can be moved by dragging and zoomed by wheel
					- SetLabels - for axes
					- ShowAll - zoom enough to se plotted data
					- ChangeRanges
					- top buttons: ShowAll, Go to origin, Clear, show/hide grid
				- general window
					- list of currently tracked graphs
						- show/hide their separate windows
						- export them??
						- create new one/rename/ delete them
				
			- Visuals
				- controls visual guidances:
					- grid with dynamic resolution (located at ref frame with selected units)
						- individual grid planes as well as 3D grid
						- ability to switch parts of it on/off, maybe change colors
					- pinheads with planets = projection on xz grid
						- ability to switch on/of, choose plane of projection
					- visual trackball - make it smaller to allow easier rolling
						- change size, position? (But keep it in screen coords)
					- camTarget indicator
					- UI for object
						- shows name on hover
						- when selected(on click) shows small window
							- Name, set as target(follow), set as ref frame
	Bonuses:
		Kepler with all trajectories
			- would require hiearchy system in simData and input files
				- wouldn't be too hard
		Dynamic addition of objects
			- could be done for stopped simulation
				- would require viewer, simMethods and parser respond to these changes
					- probably SystemUnit::UnitAdded/Removed(index) would be fine
		Make Planets colored spheres
		And add shading with sun as lightsource
			- per-pixel, bloom
		OpenGL state machine - OpenGLSM
			- maybe little bit of overkill for now
