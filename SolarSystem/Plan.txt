=====================================IN THIS COMMIT=====================================
Planning...Wrapped everything in solar namespace
========================================IMPLEMENTING PLAN========================================
- Properly implement one integration method
	- Test it with parser that returns hardoced data and textViewer
		= Would be nice to be able to vizualize it, hard to determine if its working without it
- Create OpenGLViewer
	- get OpenGL working...
- Create ImGUIViewer
	- get ImGUI working with OpenGL
- Make it prettier
	- Proper parser
	- RK4 method or other
	- Proper UI with controls
- Make sure it works correctly
	- Speeding up the sim
	- All ranges of input
- Write documentation
- If time is left, make it even more prettier
	- add colors, scenarios
	- probably dont move into 3D
========================================THOUGHTS========================================

Coordinates 
	- Input will probably be in actual units - like KM, AU or something
	- It can be simulated with doubles just fine, I guess. 
	  But OpenGL won't draw it, needs to be normalized a little.
		- Hope doubles can handle that too.
OpenGL
	- will need StartUp method - constructor might be fine
		- maybe with static flag to do it just once
Controlling the simulation
	- By viewer - ability to Stop(End), Pause the simulation as well controlling its speed
					- Pause = just render
	Speed Control
		- DT - time step - to stay deterministic
		- accumulator - tries to make simulation real-time by multiple calls to simMethod with dt
						- in the end N.dt should match elapsed real time
		- speed can be changed by:
			1. increasing DT - takes bigger steps
							- well, it doesnt speed up anythings, just roughens or smoothens the simulation
							- big DT can lead to explosion, chaos, the end
			2. decrement acc by non-one multiple of DT
						- that would speed it up if multiple<1
							- for 1/2, it would simulate two seconds for each real-world-one
						- slow down if multiple>1
							- for 2 it would simulate one second for each 2 real-world-ones
						= but it does it at expense of CPU time, becuase m=1/2 would loop 2times more than default
							- so it might quickly get bottlenecked
			3. pass multiples of DT into SimMethod
						- that would speed it up at the expense of precision
						- basically it would take bigger leaps, but not trying to catch up to real world
						- m=60, for each DT siMethod would acts as 60DT was passed
							- so, for each real/world second, it would simulate one minute
						- m is conversion ratio between real-world time and simulated-time
							- for m=60*60*24 each second would be one day.
							- But simulation might be able to handle it, might result in explosions...
		- good speed control would employ all two(three).
			- Probably keep DT constant - everything can be achieved by other two.
			- and to speed up simulation it would do more loops(2,m<1). If it could not handle it(acc>0.5),
				it would instead multiply DT(2) and revert 2. Thus loosing bit of precision
			- That's exactly how transmission works, probably.

	- In cases where Viewer takes so much time, it can be configured so it is called only so many times a second.
		Because calling it fewer times does not break simulation, only slows responsivnes and "precision of viewing".
