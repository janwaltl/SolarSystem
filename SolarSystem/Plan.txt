=====================================IN THIS COMMIT=====================================
New version of documentation.
========================================IMPLEMENTING PLAN========================================
Next:
	V. Document it & ship it
		- Add simple explicit Euler?
		- Test NotTimed properly, try pause, getters...

		Documentation:
			- make table data in theory part
			- give credits to last years physics course, numerical recipies
			- test implicit solution for correctness
			- viewers - ImGuiViewer
							- OpenGLBackEnd, ImGuiBackend - show examples of ImGui
							- explain lineTrails algorithm
							- somehow summarize GUIs
							- mention OMSAR in together with SimDataDrawer?
			- replay DLC
				- two parts:recording & replaying
					-record - explain ViewAndRecord concept
								- binary file, bla bla...see source code...
					-replaying - Parser,Method,Viewer
						- parser - only for correct size of data and intial conditions
						- simMethod - utilizes simTime to pick correct record
						- replayerViewer - recycles ImGuiViewer
			- what has not been done
				- physics unit system
				- templatize vector
				- idea on expansion to 3D
			- user guide
				- explain consoleControl
				- compiling for Windows
					- .sln should be enough
					- libraries are present
				- compiled binaries
					- redist
				- compiling for Linux
					- needs to compile GLFW and GLEW
					- make makefile?
	VI. OPTIONAL

		- Create physics unit system
			- can redefine simData_t to make it a structure with data and in what units they are
				- would also contain conversion function and all definitions of units
					- sort of like chrono - period, denominator,numerator
