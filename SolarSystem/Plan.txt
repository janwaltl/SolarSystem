=====================================IN THIS COMMIT=====================================
Cleaning #includes and files in general. Part III
	- almost zero warnings build
========================================IMPLEMENTING PLAN========================================
Next:
	ConsoleControl needs to be properly tested.

	V. Document it & ship it
		- Rename Settings to Constants.
		- Constants instead of magic values
		- resolve run-time library warning
		- go through all files, look for temp comments, includes, anything that is obsolete...
	VI. OPTIONAL
		- Little bit nicer/cleaner GUI.
			- Movable,scalable GUI windows. Allow different window size.

		- Create physics unit system
			- can redefine simData_t to make it a structure with data and in what units they are
				- would also contain conversion function and all definitions of units
					- sort of like chrono - period, denominator,numerator

		- Timing does not feel right
			= is better now, probably just fine

		- Solar parser would benefit from saving too(same as formatted?)
