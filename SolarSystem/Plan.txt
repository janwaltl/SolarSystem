=====================================IN THIS COMMIT=====================================
Fixed formattedParser's saving.
Minor tweaks in console.
========================================IMPLEMENTING PLAN========================================
Next:
	ConsoleControl needs to be properly tested.

	V. Document it & ship it
		- Clean #include dependecies
		- Rename Settings to Constants.
		- Constants instead of magic values
		- SORT all compile warnings 
			- even double->float ? static cast makes it ugly
		- go through all files, look for temp comments, includes, anything that is obsolete...
	VI. OPTIONAL
		- Little bit nicer/cleaner GUI.
			- Movable,scalable GUI windows. Allow different window size.

		- Create physics unit system
			- can redefine simData_t to make it a structure with data and in what units they are
				- would also contain conversion function and all definitions of units
					- sort of like chrono - period, denominator,numerator

		- Timing does not feel right
			= is better now, probably just fine

		- Solar parser would benefit from saving too(same as formatted?)
