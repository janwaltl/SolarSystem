=====================================IN THIS COMMIT=====================================
Got Grid somewhat working - needs polishing.
Small fix to movement speed to sides.
========================================IMPLEMENTING PLAN========================================

Remarks:
	Acknowledge third parties in documentation.
	Well, reorganize documentation.
		- probably not worth the effort.
		- but moving user guide to beggining is doable.
	Resolve speeding/slowing down while recording.
		- won't be easy - either we loose O(1) search in file or we get wrong replaying speed
			- went for wrong replaying speed for now
TODOs/IDEAS:
	Add Inverses of matrices in UBO in camera class if needed.
	Why is Ortho weirdly clipped when projecting to the center?
		- now projecting to near clipping plane, need to resolve it - there's typo or bug in matrices somewhere.
	Camera's aspect ratio?
	Fix all Begin/End for windows
	Decide on Ratio class
		- too much work with operators, but it distinguishes it from simple double
!!	Graphs - object's energy is not implemented 
	Graphs tweaks
		- better grid system, this one looks weird when zooming
		- Scientific notation - labels and input ranges, checkbox for autoscale 
		- maybe preview on hover over the list instead of side window
		- csv export would be too hard
		- separate window resizing - part of whole UI resize thing
	Grid
		- better resizing, sort that frac,fade mess
			- use 3 grids, cycle trough them, while always resizing the hidden one
				- small grid is smaller than bigger
				- proper fading
			- or bigger would fade away, smaller will change color to same as bigger
		- zooming in should behave same
		- get offset working, place it at cam's target
Plan:
	UI overhaul:
		- Top-bar with dropdown windows
			- TopBar
				- StateButtons to open individual windows
				- Center:
					- play, pause, resume
			- SimControls
				- just current SimControls
				- usage statistics
				- save/load/restart
				- name of current simMethod?
				- tickbox for break on collision?
				- graph of frameTime,FPS?
					- with stability line
			- SimData - Done
			- CameraControls - Done
			- Graphs - Done
			- Visuals
				- controls visual guidances:
					- grid with dynamic resolution (located at ref frame with selected units)
						- individual grid planes as well as 3D grid
						
					- pinheads with planets = projection on xz grid
						- ability to switch on/of, choose plane of projection
					- visual trackball - make it smaller to allow easier rolling
						- change size, position? (But keep it in screen coords)
					- camTarget indicator
					- UI for object
						- shows name on hover
						- when selected(on click) shows small window
							- Name, set as target(follow), set as ref frame
	Bonuses:
		Kepler with all trajectories
			- would require hiearchy system in simData and input files
				- wouldn't be too hard
		Dynamic addition of objects
			- could be done for stopped simulation
				- would require viewer, simMethods and parser respond to these changes
					- probably SystemUnit::UnitAdded/Removed(index) would be fine
		Make Planets colored spheres
		And add shading with sun as lightsource
			- per-pixel, bloom
		OpenGL state machine - OpenGLSM
			- maybe little bit of overkill for now

Po,Ut - start working on grid
		- buffer with 100x100 grid, offset, scale uniforms
		- z-fade?
		- controls - switch between grid planes
		- add pin-heads
			- draw lines
			- draw circles
		- visualize cam's target?
St - finish grid
	- controls - Top Menu bar shows size ratio of both grid tiles
Ct,Pa,So,Ne
	- top menu bar
		-integrate simControls and rest of windows
	- icons?
	- proper winSize boundaries, test scaling on big PC
	- mouse picking
		- needs inverses of matrices
		- on hover show just name?
		- on right - center, follow
	-smaller, visible trackball
3D planets or Kepler
