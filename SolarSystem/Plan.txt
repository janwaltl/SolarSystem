=====================================IN THIS COMMIT=====================================
Working on trackball. TBC
========================================IMPLEMENTING PLAN========================================
Remarks:
	Acknowledge third parties in documentation.
	Well, reorganize documentation.
		- probably not worth the effort.
		- but moving user guide to beggining is doable.
	Resolve speeding/slowing down while recording.
		- won't be easy - either we loose O(1) search in file or we get wrong replaying speed
			- went for wrong replaying speed for now
Test:
	Vector ops correctness.
	MakeMatrix fcs.
TODOs:
	Inverse of matrix if needed.
		- UBO in camera class
	Fix ReplayerViewer.
	Why is Ortho weirdly clipped when projecting to the center?
		- now projecting to near clipping plane, need to resolve it there's typo or bug in matrices somewhere.
Plan:
	Add ArcBall controlls
		- amount is controlled by mouse movement and action based on pressed buttons:
			- LeftMouse: rotate around center of screen
				- or camera's target
			- RightMouse: Panning to sides 
						- on plane with normal given by view direction and position by camera's position
						- move camera nad its target location
			- WheelMouse: Zooming
				- zoom to cam's target
			- MiddleMouse: LookAround
				- rotate using trackball from camera's position

	Add Camera controlls
		- ability to follow a planet - both as target and as relative position
		- UI around planets to select them, target them, go to them
	UI overhaul.
		- 
	Bonuses:
		Make Planets colored spheres
		And add shading with sun as lightsource
			- per-pixel, bloom
		OpenGL state machine - OpenGLSM
		Kepler with all trajectories
