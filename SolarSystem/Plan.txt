=====================================IN THIS COMMIT=====================================
Added SolarParser.
Some basic testing.
========================================IMPLEMENTING PLAN========================================
Next:
	ConsoleControl needs to be properly tested.
	Add some confirmation messages, to know if argument was chosen and it did not defaulted to other...
	V. Document it & ship it
		- Clean #include dependecies
		- Rename Settings to Constants.
		- Constants instead of magic values
		- Apparently saving does not work as expected
			- no name or color
			- wrong units, needs to convert to SI
		- SORT all compile warnings
		- go through all files, look for temp comments, includes, anything that is obsolete...
	VI. OPTIONAL
		- Little bit nicer/cleaner GUI.
			- Positions of windows. Allow different winSizes?
		- Create physics unit system
			- can redefine simData_t to make it a structure with data and in what units they are
				- would also contain conversion function and all definitions of units
					- sort of like chrono - period, denominator,numerator
		- Timing does not feel right
			- with all the casting, precision...
