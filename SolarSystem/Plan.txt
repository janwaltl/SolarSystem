=====================================IN THIS COMMIT=====================================
Refactored SimDataDrawer into using newly added camera.
	- few fixes in matrices.
Temporarely disabled ReplayerViewer.
========================================IMPLEMENTING PLAN========================================
Remarks:
	Acknowledge third parties in documentation.
	Well, reorganize documentation.
		- probably not worth the effort.
		- but moving user guide to beggining is doable.
	Resolve speeding/slowing down while recording.
		- won't be easy - either we loose O(1) search in file or we get wrong replaying speed
			- went for wrong replaying speed for now
Test:
	Vector ops correctness.
	MakeMatrix fcs.
TODOs:
	Inverse of matrix if needed.
		- UBO in camera class
	Fix ReplayerViewer.
Plan:
	Convert current 2D to 2D in 3D using vectors, matrices
		- Use vectors and matrices for current drawing - lines, points
		- Controlled by keyboard
	Add ArcBall controlls
		- use mouse drag from ImGui
	Add Camera controlls
		- ability to follow a planet - both as target and as relative position
		- UI around planets to select them, target them, go to them
	Bonuses:
		Make Planets colored spheres
		And add shading with sun as lightsource
			- per-pixel, bloom
		OpenGL state machine - OpenGLSM
